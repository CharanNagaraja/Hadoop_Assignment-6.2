1)Fetch date and temperature from temperature_data where zip code is greater than
300000 and less than 399999.

SELECT 
from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(date,'yyyy-MM-dd'),'MM-dd-yyyy') as date,
temperature 
FROM  custom.temperature_data
WHERE zip_code > 300000 AND zip_code < 399999 ;


2) Calculate maximum temperature corresponding to every year from temperature_data
table.

select year , temperature , ranking ,zip_code from
(
select YEAR(date) as year ,
temperature,
rank() OVER (PARTITION by YEAR(date) ORDER by temperature DESC) AS ranking,
zip_code
FROM temperature_data
) table
WHERE ranking = 1 ;


3)Calculate maximum temperature from temperature_data table corresponding to those
years which have at least 2 entries in the table.



select year,
temperature,
ranking,
countOfYear
FROM
(select year,
temperature,
ranking,
count(year) over (PARTITION BY YEAR) as countOfYear
from(
select YEAR(date) as year ,
temperature,
rank() OVER (PARTITION by YEAR(date) ORDER by temperature DESC) AS ranking,
COUNT(YEAR(date)) OVER (PARTITION by YEAR(date)  ) AS count
FROM temperature_data
)table1
WHERE ranking = 1 
) table2
where countOfYear>=2;



4) Create a view on the top of last query, name it temperature_data_vw.

CREATE VIEW temperature_data_vw as
select year,
temperature,
ranking,
countOfYear
FROM
(select year,
temperature,
ranking,
count(year) over (PARTITION BY YEAR) as countOfYear
from(
select YEAR(date) as year ,
temperature,
rank() OVER (PARTITION by YEAR(date) ORDER by temperature DESC) AS ranking,
COUNT(YEAR(date)) OVER (PARTITION by YEAR(date)  ) AS count
FROM temperature_data
)table1
WHERE ranking = 1 
) table2
where countOfYear>=2;




5) Export contents from temperature_data_vw to a file in local file system, such that each
file is '|' delimited.

INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY'/home/acadgild/'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|'
select * from temperature_data_vw;
